# Home Assistant — dashboards & integrations

Home Assistant runs on [[kdk-dkr-02]] (network_mode host) with Node-RED
alongside it. **Dashboards, themes, and packages are GitOps-owned** since
2026-09-21: `stacks/home-assistant/config/{dashboards,themes,packages}` is
copied into `/opt/kdk-lab/home-assistant/config/` by the stack's Komodo
`pre_deploy`. The rest of the HA config (`configuration.yaml`, `.storage`,
`secrets.yaml`, `custom_components`) and the Node-RED flow stay host-side
under `/opt/kdk-lab/home-assistant/`.

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | [[kdk-dkr-02]] (10.1.30.21, VLAN 30), HA + Node-RED, HomeKit bridge |
| Login | **Authelia OIDC** (`hass-oidc-auth` custom component, client `homeassistant`, group `dashboard-users`); local login kept as fallback (usernames `jmack`/`rach`) |
| Theme | **Kodiak** (INK GROUND dark, `config/themes/kodiak.yaml`), set as backend default on start |
| Dashboards | **Home** (iOS-Home-style rooms, sections+tile), **Roborock**, **Homelab** — YAML-mode, registered in `configuration.yaml` |
| Home controls | per-room sections: blinds (Zigbee covers), theater lights (+group), T9 thermostat, ceiling fan, outlets, Bosch dishwasher, HomePods/Apple TVs |
| Homelab telemetry | REST sensors pulling [[observability]] Prometheus (`10.1.20.30:9090`): iDRAC fans/temps/power + per-host CPU/mem/uptime, plus the [[nut]] UPS |
| Roborock | fully local vacuum — live map (tap-to-clean), per-room buttons, routines, per-room last-cleaned stamps, next-run; automation in Node-RED |
| Maintenance chores | **Vikunja is the single source of truth** (tasks.kmkdp.com project 6); HA shows them via a command_line sensor; Node-RED bridges completions both ways |
| Other integrations | Apple TV ×several, Lutron Caséta, Zigbee2MQTT (Sonoff dongle), HomeKit bridge/controller, [[nut]] UPS |
| Scrypted | cameras reach HA only via HomeKit today (no video); the `koush/ha_scrypted` HACS integration is installed, pending the correct Scrypted login |

## Dashboards

- **Home** (`/home-controls`) — sections per room (Living Room, Kitchen,
  Dishwasher, Master Bedroom, Master Bathroom, Bedrooms, Theater, Basement,
  Garage, Vacuum), tile cards with features, emulating the iOS Home app.
  The family reaches it same-tab from the home.kmkdp.com Kodiak sidebar.
- **Roborock** (`/roborock-vac`) — live map (HACS `lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card`,
  manual calibration — do not re-derive), status/schedule/next-run, rooms-cleaned
  stamps, routines, per-room clean, Vikunja chore list + dock sensors.
- **Homelab** (`/homelab-hw`) — iDRAC gauges for [[kdk-hyp-01]] and
  [[kdk-nas-01]], the [[nut]] UPS, and CPU/memory/uptime for all monitored hosts.

## Roborock ↔ Vikunja bridge (Node-RED)

The old duplicate schedulers (Node-RED maintenance timers + `rr_maint_*`
booleans in HomeKit + a dashboard card) were removed 2026-09-21. Now:

- Vikunja project 6 ("Robot Vacuum") holds the recurring chores
  (repeat-from-completion).
- Node-RED polls the project every 5 min; when a chore is completed in
  Vikunja it presses the matching consumable-reset buttons (brush/filter/bag).
- Dock-sensor evidence auto-completes "Fill water" (water-shortage clears /
  clean tank returns).
- Node-RED stamps `input_datetime.rr_last_clean_<room>` when it dispatches
  rooms (it is the sole dispatcher) and `rr_next_run` from the schedule.

## Verify

```sh
# HA up + a homelab sensor populated
ssh kdkadmin@10.1.30.21 'curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(sudo cat \
  /opt/kdk-lab/home-assistant/node-red/flows_cred.json | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)[chr(39)+\"38978576.ca0eea\"+chr(39)][\"access_token\"])")" \
  http://10.1.30.21:8123/api/states/sensor.kdk_hyp_01_cpu_temp'
```

## Troubleshooting

- **A card control does nothing** — check the entity's `supported_features`;
  covers need OPEN/CLOSE/SET_POSITION. Prefer `tile` cards with features over
  `entities` rows for covers/vacuums.
- **Homelab sensors `unavailable`** — HA must reach Prometheus at
  `10.1.20.30:9090`; the value template returns `unavailable` on an empty
  query result.
- **Server temps show °F** — omit `device_class: temperature` (HA's imperial
  unit system converts it); keep unit `°C` + `state_class: measurement`.
- **Chore card says unavailable** — the command_line sensor needs
  `/config/.vikunja_token` (host-managed, 0600) and tasks.kmkdp.com reachable.
- Editing an existing YAML dashboard file is picked up on browser refresh;
  **registering a new dashboard or the themes dir needs an HA restart**;
  package edits reload with Developer Tools → "Reload all YAML".
- **OIDC login loop / missing button** — check `auth_oidc:` in
  `configuration.yaml`, the Authelia client `homeassistant`
  (PKCE S256 + `client_secret_post`), and that the user's LLDAP username
  matches the HA username (`jmack`/`rach` — linking is by username).

## Configuration

- Dashboards/themes/packages: **repo** `stacks/home-assistant/config/…` →
  pre_deploy copies to `/opt/kdk-lab/home-assistant/config/…` (url path must
  contain a hyphen; new dashboards need an HA restart).
- Host-side: `configuration.yaml` (incl. `auth_oidc:`), `secrets.yaml`,
  `/config/.vikunja_token`, `custom_components/auth_oidc`.
- Node-RED: `/opt/kdk-lab/home-assistant/node-red/` (Roborock automation +
  Vikunja bridge; token in the "vik auth" function node).
- HomeKit: HA entities are exposed through the existing paired "HASS Bridge"
  (include list in `.storage/core.config_entries` — stop HA before editing).

## Secret Rotation

`home-assistant-nodered-token` (Node-RED → HA), `kdk-ups-01-nut-upsd` (NUT
client), `homeassistant-oidc-client` (Authelia client secret; digest in the
DMZ `/secrets/authelia-app-secrets/homeassistant_client_secret`, plaintext in
HA `secrets.yaml`), `vikunja-api-ro` (chore sensor + Node-RED bridge),
`scrypted-admin` (once the Scrypted integration is completed).
